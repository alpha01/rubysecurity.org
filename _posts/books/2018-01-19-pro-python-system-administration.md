Pro Python System Administration is an advanced technical book. The book already assumes you have a strong knowledge of Python and senior level system administration experience. This book doesn’t hold your hand whatsoever. If you don’t know how to work with Python modules and or aren’t well versed in areas such as SNMP, Apache, ISC-dhcpd, RRDtool, Nagios, and RabbitMQ, then you will be lost reading this book. This book also covers other areas such as Django, database design, as well as some cloud computing using AWS. Before reading this book, I’ve tough it was going to cover basic simple problems solved by some Python automation. Instead this book describes the use of some really complex Python tools to solve a complex problem. You won’t be writing Python programs from scratch with this book, instead you’ll be downloading the <a href="https://github.com/Apress/pro-python-system-admin-14" target="_blank">code</a> for the respective applications and then analyzing the program on how exactly works.  

I feel this book is mainly for those that need concrete examples on how to write complex Python programs. For example, I have no use of any of the Python tools described in this book (maybe the perhaps the Nagios website availability script), however this book will definitely help if I ever would need to architect a complex sysadmin related tool.

This is certainly not a beginners book, and I'm glad to see the "Pro" in this Apress title actually holds to be true!
