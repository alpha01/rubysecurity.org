WordPress powers a shitload of websites. WordPress is an easy to use and powerful web application, yet it is wrongfully infamous for it’s security (or to many lack their off). This free e-book is a short Question/Answer paper from three different professional WordPress developers. Although the e-book was published in 2012, practically all of the content is still relevant. This book goes through a handful of common WordPress security questions. Some example questions include:
**What’s the one, overriding security essential that goes into every project you work on?
If you had one piece of WordPress security advice to share, what would it be?**

All of which are uniquely answered by all three WordPress professionals based on their experience. One thing that I noticed is that most of the answers were mainly concerning WordPress in a shared hosting environment. I would’ve like to see tips regarding securing WordPress in a complex environment, and large high traffic/availability environment.  As well as securing WordPress using third party tools like web application firewalls, though I can foresee this being somewhat out of scope.

I have a solid understanding of locking down a WordPress application. Even, as seasoned as user, administrator, and up to a certain point a; a developer. I actually learned something really important on securing WordPress that I completely oversee. That is removing world/all readable access to wp-config.php, this is something that I completely never thought of, yet without this change anyone can easily grab your database credentials. Another good tip I got by reading this free e-book was on dealing with hosting providers.

WordPress is like any other web application, yet idiots like to scrutinize it in a negative way. Almost as like if their shit doesn’t smell, but I digress.  Like any other web application, it’s just a matter of keeping up with updates, restricting access, and having common sense of what third party code to integrate onto your application; will help you keep a your website secure and running without hiccups.

Although much of the content is mentioned on the official WordPress security guides (<a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress" target="_blank">https://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress</a> and <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_My_site_was_hacked" target="_blank">https://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_My_site_was_hacked</a>) I'd highly recommend anyone using WordPress to read this free e-book.
