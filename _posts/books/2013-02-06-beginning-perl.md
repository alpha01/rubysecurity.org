It only took me exactly two years to read the Apress book Beginning Perl by James Lee, and I would have to admit this is the best programming book that I’ve read so far. I would need to give this book high praise as it was easy and fun to read ( pretty much taught me programming in Perl. Even tough I don’t use Perl on a daily bases, nor is Perl my prefer language of choice to write scripts ) but thanks to this book I could confidently read other programmers perl code and have an understanding on what’s going on in their program.

I would highly recommended this book to anybody starting or wanting to learn Perl.
