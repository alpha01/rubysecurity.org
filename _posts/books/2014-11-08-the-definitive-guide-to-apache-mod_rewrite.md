title: The Definitive Guide to Apache mod_rewrite

I'm sure we've all at some point in time, had Google'd for a particular mod_rewrite rule to solve some particular URL rewrite problem that we wanted to fix or implement. The book Definitive Guide to Apache mod_rewrite aims to help us understand what each line in an mod_rewrite conditional rule set means. Unlike other technical books, what makes this book unique is that it has a strong focus on when NOT to use mod_rewrite. The chapters are well structure, the content builds upon each chapter you finish reading. Much of the information provided by this book can be found on the official mod_rewrite documentation, however this book goes beyond the documentation providing easy to understand examples following up each topic.

One important thing to keep in mind prior to reading this book. Although this book has a chapter dedicated to regular expressions, in order to effectively use mod_rewrite, it is extremely important that you fully understand how regular expressions work. Thus said, this short comprehensive book is practically all you need to become a mod_rewrite ninja. I've been working with mod_rewrite for quite some time now, and even I learned new tricks thanks to this book.

The only downside to this book is it's price. Apress seriously needs to lower the prices of their books, $41.99 for an E-Book is utterly ridiculous, especially since their competitors offer identical books for half their price.

### Rating: 4/5
