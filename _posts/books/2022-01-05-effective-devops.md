The last time I was fooled by a title was when I read the book <a href="https://www.rubysecurity.org/books_Pro-Docker" taget="_blank">Pro Docker</a> by Apress. Now O’Reilly Media joins that coveted list with their book Effective DevOps: Building a Culture of Collaboration, Affinity, and Tooling at Scale. This book should be titled, “Effective Management in a diverse work environment”. This book is aimed for managers rather than the regular day-to-day engineers. While normally, I would consider this to be a very important topic, however some of the approaches that the authors show cased their concepts was to me somewhat of a let down. Unlike the steaming pile of shit that was <a href="https://www.rubysecurity.org/books_Pro-Docker" taget="_blank">Pro Docker</a>, this book does have some good content. Like describing some of the patterns that lead to good team collaboration, and overall excellent examples of accomplishing good leadership.

My major problem with this book. Is the forced diversity, as solution for an effective team. Alluding if being part of the same certain ethnic group, race, or sex causes the same thoughts of ideas in the workplace, therefore diversity is needed. The major problem with this train of thought is that itself is very judgemental to begin with! This ideology definitely manifests in the authors writing.

Lastly, perhaps maybe because I wasn’t the target audience for this book, but I felt this book dragged a lot. The authors are clearly very knowledgeable in this topic, however while this book does have some excellent content, at certain times it felt to me that there was way too much filler content, to an otherwise good examples.
