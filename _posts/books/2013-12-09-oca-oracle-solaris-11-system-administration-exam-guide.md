title: OCA Oracle Solaris 11 System Administration Exam Guide

Unlike the <a href="https://www.rubysecurity.org/books_oracle-solaris-11-system-administration" target="_blank">Oracle Solaris 11 System Administration The Complete Reference</a> book I read a few months back, this book definitely covers very well network system configuration in Solaris 11, as it's part of the Solaris 11 System Administrator certification curriculum. Sadly as of this writing, ipf firewall configuration in Solaris 11 is not a requirement for the Oracle Certified Associate Solaris 11 certification, which is the reason it's not covered on this book. On the bright side, this book does an excellent job explaining layer 2 and 3 network system configuration and zone configurations in Solaris. Coming from a Solaris sysadmin standpoint, in my opinion this book has much better content than the official Oracle Press Solaris 11 reference book. Which understandably, makes sense given that it's centric to the certification.

Sadly, ipfilter firewall configuration is not a certification exam objective, so it's not mentioned in this book. Other than that, this book is a must read for any new Solaris system administrator.

### Rating: 4/5
