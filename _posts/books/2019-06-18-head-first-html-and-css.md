Head First HTML and CSS, A Learner's Guide to Creating Standards-Based Web Pages is the very first book in the Head First book series that I’ve read, and I must say, I’m really impressed by it. The Head First books are O’Reilly’s equivalent to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Dummies" target="_blank">For Dummies</a> books, and unlike the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DOS-Dummies-Dan-Gookin/dp/0764503618" target="_blank">DOS for Dummies</a> book that I’ve read  about 15 years ago, Head First HTML and CSS completely blows it out of the water. This book has tons of simple easy to follow examples and concepts, on top of that a very humoristic approach to learning. It does an excellent job showcasing the topics in a visual and comprehensive manner.

About half of the content in this book is divided between HTML and CSS. The only bad thing that I can think about this book is that it’s really meant to be read using the physical dead tree format. This book had some well thought out puzzles that are practically impossible to do if you’re using an ebook.

I haven’t read many HTML or CSS books, but I’m confident to suggest and recommend that this is the best beginner HTML and CSS book that anyone wanting to become a web developer should read first.
