This book serves as companion to <a href="https://www.rubysecurity.org/RHCSA-RHCE_Red_Hat_Linux_Certification_Study_Guide_Sixth_Edition" target="_blank">RHCSA/RHCE Red Hat Linux Certification Study Guide (Sixth Edition)</a>. The main goal of this book is to prepare the user for the certification exams using an actual working live virtual lab environment. The virtual lab environment consists of three pre-configured Scientific Linux KVM raw images; surprising enough theyâ€™re still available for download and still completely useable <a href="https://www.mhprofessionalresources.com//mediacenter/index.php?isbn=9780071801607&x=101&y=32" target="_blank">https://www.mhprofessionalresources.com//mediacenter/index.php?isbn=9780071801607&x=101&y=32</a> (I just had to update the custom yum repo url). I did not have any problems with any of the example labs in this book. Like <a href="https://www.rubysecurity.org/RHCSA-RHCE_Red_Hat_Linux_Certification_Study_Guide_Sixth_Edition" target="_blank">RHCSA/RHCE Red Hat Linux Certification Study Guide (Sixth Edition)</a>, at the end of each chapter, in addition to some sample questions; example labs are also followed based on the three pre-configured virtual environments.

This book is more of a primer, were it goes over the main exam objectives extremely briefly (which works as a great refresher). It is significant shorter than the other book; main difference is the labs on this book are significantly much more complex. Originally, I read both books jointly, however I feel the best approach to get the most of out this was was to first read <a href="https://www.rubysecurity.org/RHCSA-RHCE_Red_Hat_Linux_Certification_Study_Guide_Sixth_Edition" target="_blank">RHCSA/RHCE Red Hat Linux Certification Study Guide (Sixth Edition)</a>, then continue on with this book. The reason being is that the chapter topics are exactly the same on both books.
