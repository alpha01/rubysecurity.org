title: The CompTIA Cloud Essentials Certification Study Guide

The CompTIA Cloud Essentials Certification Study Guide by McGraw-Hill Education has been the most simplistic technical certification book that I’ve ever read. Just under 200 pages, this book covers just about everything needed to pass the <a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/cloud-essentials" target="_blank">CompTIA Cloud Essentials exam</a>. Given that the certification it self is mostly high level theoretical cloud computing and not a technical problem solving, it makes sense why this book was fairly short and easy to read. Thus said, the exam itself was a little more difficult than anticipated.  Comparing with it the <a href="https://www.antoniobaltazar.com/files/AWS_Certified_Cloud_Practitioner_certificate.pdf" target="_blank">AWS Cloud Practitioner</a> exam, the  CompTIA Cloud Essentials exam was far more difficult in my opinion.

I took the exam (CLO-001)  a few days, and <a href="http://www.antoniobaltazar.com/files/CompTIA-Cloud-Essentials-certificate.pdf" target="_blank">successfully passed</a> it only using this book as my study material! Like any other McGraw-Hill Education certification guide, each chapter ends with sample questions which help you reassure your knowledge of the topic that was covered. The only thing this book lacked of was more content regarding The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), which is heavy mentioned in the exam. This book only tells you how cloud computing affects ITIL, it does not fully explain to you what ITIL is to start with.

The only draw back of this book is not necessarily its fault. There were many instances where certain content was mentioned that wasn’t quite accurate if we don’t take Amazon Web Services into consideration. Which is kind of scary to see how AWS has shapped cloud computing from the time this book was published in 2012.
