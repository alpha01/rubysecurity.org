I've been a long time subscriber of Linux Journal magazine, and Kyle Rankin's column is quite frankly why I continue to be Linux Journal subscriber. His book DevOps Troubleshooting: Linux Server Best Practices, is a general purpose troubleshooting guide to the most common problems encountered in any  Linux system. Linux servers are everywhere, if you're a developer, QA engineer, DBA, or a sysadmin, this book has the necessary content for the entire development and operations departments need as a common middle grounds of basic server troubleshooting skills without necessarily being a Linux expert. This book describes tools, and tricks for troubleshooting performance (load, CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc.), boot, network, DNS, email, database, and hardware related problems. 

This book does NOT, walk you through setting up a Linux server. Most likely if you're reading this book, you're already working with one, as well as have the basic Linux knowledge to do so.

I would definitely recommend book. Thus said, as a mid-level/senior Linux systems administrator, I practically already accumulated the majority of the troubleshooting content described in the book with the exception of the chapters related to troubleshooting email and database, which I definitely learned new things thanks to this book. I also found the chapter related hardware problems really interesting, especially after having already encountered some of them!
