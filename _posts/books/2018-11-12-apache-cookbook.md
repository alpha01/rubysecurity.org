Apache Cookbook is yet another one of those books that I bought over a decade, and never completed reading it, in it’s entirely.  As I continue to finally read my old tech books so I can clear out my book shelve, this is a somewhat outdated book by today’s standards. This book covers Apache versions 1.3, 1.4, 2.0, and 2.2; and the some differences between them.

I’d say about 60% of the content is still valid. Though you have to take this with a grain of salt. I say this is because of the nature of how this book is structured. Like other O’reilly “Cookbook” series, Apache Cookbook breaks down each topic with a question or problem, it then will describe you how to solve that particular problem.  All questions/problems are still ones that you might encountered if you’re administrating an Apache web server in 2018, however some of the answers (recipes) that this book opts for, may be deprecated and replaced with something else. The perfect example is the chapter regarding dynamic content, of which most of the examples were using old CGI configurations and techniques. This book definitely shines showing you the entire process on how to troubleshoot problems with Apache.

The book assumes you have basic knowledge of Apache and Server and Client concepts. If you’re completely new to server administration, you may find this book a bit to advance. Thus said, reading this book you’ll learn basic concepts like Apache name based and IP based virtual hosting, logging, rewriting urls, security, SSL, proxy configuration, and Apache performance concepts and techniques.
