The Sams Teach Yourself SQL in 10 Minutes series is the best selling SQL book series, and after reading this book (although older version since I read the second edition), I can see why that is the case. This is a really good SQL good. It is SQL agnostic, though it does mention the difference between major RDMS, and also provides the different implementations using SQL Server, Oracle, and on a few occasions even MySQL.

This book goes into far more detail than <a href="https://www.rubysecurity.org/Sams-Teach-Yourself-MySQL-in-10-Minutes" target="_blank">MySQL in 10 minutes</a>. I read both books jointly, and I think this is the best approach for anyone new to SQL and if youâ€™re learning via MySQL. Unlike <a href="https://www.rubysecurity.org/Sams-Teach-Yourself-MySQL-in-10-Minutes" target="_blank">MySQL in 10 minutes</a>, this book does have consequently updated editions published. 

This book was extremely easy to follow and very well written, and in my opinion it is perhaps the best introductory SQL book.
