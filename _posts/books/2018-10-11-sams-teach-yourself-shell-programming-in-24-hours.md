This is yet another one of those books that I bought over a decade ago, but never finished reading it in it’s entirety. Instead, I originally simply read portions of it. Well, now I went back and re-read this book completely, and definitely learned new things! This book only covers the plain bourne (sh) shell and no other (thank goodness) . 

Published in 1999, about 90% percent of the content covered in this book still applies to Bash shell programming in 2018.  I did, however encountered some interesting compatibility problems with GNU’s Bourne Again bash shell, with some of the examples described in this book. As this book was not directly written with that shell in mind.

In order to be fully proficient in shell programming, you need to be well acquainted with the tons of the built-in tools that are part of the shell as well as other important utilities that are part of a Unix/Linux operating system. This book starts you off with the absolute shell basics like working with files and directories, to then actual programming concepts like shell variables, functions, parameters, etc. To finally advance topics like regular expressions, input/output, signal handling, debugging techniques, and portable shell programming. This book also covers briefly covers, but albeit really good, both sed and awk.

Most if not all of the examples described in this book were really easy to follow, however this book never really felt like a beginners book. I really liked how it progressed, it eventually became more of an advance book by the chapter.
