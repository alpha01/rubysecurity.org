Pragmatic Guide to Subversion is a short book aimed for experience developers already experienced using other source code version control tools; i.e., Git. The book is divided into eight sections, each section consisting of really short tasks explaining the respective topic. Each task is presented using traditional svn command line tool, Tortoise, and Cornerstone. Prior to reading this book I knew very little, to practically nothing about using or administrating Subversion repositories. This book did excellent job in teaching me how to use Subversion! Since I already know how to use Git, I was able to easily understand the material mentioned in the book see and how Subversion differs to Git. Of course this book doesn't explain everything their is to Subversion, but it does a pretty damn good job. 

Anyone new to source control management would probably have a hard time reading this book, thus said anyone already familiar with Git and want to quickly learn Subversion, then this book is for you.
