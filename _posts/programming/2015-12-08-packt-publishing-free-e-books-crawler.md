I'm a big fan of Packt Publishing, and have purchased quite a few books from them. So when I first heard a couple of months back that they were going to give out free e-books everyday, my jaw literally dropped. <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning" target="_blank">https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning</a>

I've normally been manually checking the site everyday for books that I might be interested on reading. The problem with this, is that their have been days that I missed out getting some free books that I would've love to read. So I wrote a short script that would notify me if there's a free book available that I might be interested in reading. I would've love if Packt Publishing provided an rss feed so I can easily get notifications of their free books. Thus said, I really can't complain since they're already kind enough to give the world free e-books to spread knowledge.
