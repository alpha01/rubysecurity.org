On my new CentOS 6 powered BIND DNS server, it took a while to figure out why my custom jailed BIND configuration was not able to load any zone data files, even though the zone data files did not had any sort of syntax errors. Of which I verified using the `named-checkzone` utility.


### Errors

```bash

I came to realize the issue was within my named.conf master config file. Since I'm using BIND 9.7.3 (and newer versions), it turns out that the zone name needs to have a dot (`.`) at the end of the domain name. This was really annoying since it appears that earlier versions didn't tagged this an error and were able to load up zone files perfectly fine without the addition of the dot character at the end of the zone file name. Luckily, I was able to fix the issue, which by the way, the `named-checkconf` utility was not able to detect this problem.

Broken:

```bash
zone "rubysecurity.org" IN {
        type master;
        file "etc/db.rubysecurity.org";
        allow-update { key rndc-key; };
        allow-query { any; };

};
```

Fix:

```bash
zone "rubysecurity.org." IN {
        type master;
        file "etc/db.rubysecurity.org";
        allow-update { key rndc-key; };
        allow-query { any; };

};
```
