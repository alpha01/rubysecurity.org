## About

Why rubysecurity.org?

I originally planned on using this name because the site was initially going to be about my security research and development (Metasploit Meterpreter scripting). Since I'm pretty constraint in time at the moment to focus on this area at this point in time, I have put that on hold. (Though, I plan on doing extensive security research and add my fair share to make the internet a much safer place with contributions to the Metasploit Project in the near future).

This site is focused on documenting my experiences as both a user and Linux Systems Administrator; the good, bad, and the ugly. Also about the occasional programming project and gotchas, and finally, technical book reviews.
